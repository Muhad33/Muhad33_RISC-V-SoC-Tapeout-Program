# 🖥️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program — VSD  
### RISC-V VSD Participants India  

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** as I learn, implement, and practice tasks in the path from **RTL → GDSII** using open-source tools.  

> *"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and strengthen the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."*
