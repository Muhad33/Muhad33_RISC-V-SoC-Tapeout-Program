# Muhad33_RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
This repository documents the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program — starting from RTL design and simulation, all the way to physical design (GDSII). The program is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V initiative. Each week’s progress, tasks, and learnings are documented here in a structured format for future reference and knowledge sharing.
